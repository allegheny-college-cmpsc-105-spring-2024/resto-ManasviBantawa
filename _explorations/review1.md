Habesha Delight was suchhhhh a delight! This restaurant was fascinating! The ambiance was nice, and the food was great! The service was incredible and made me feel comfortable. The chef came to see us, and it was a wonderful experience. The guests were lovely and it created a great environment. I would definitely recommend anyone to visit Habesha Delight. The price was great for the food and service. I went with my family and it was definitely worth the time, and would recommend a family trip.
