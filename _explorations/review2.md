After opening its doors in 1925 with a heartfelt mission to bring joy to families, Villa Borghese has become a culinary institution, consistently delivering excellence for nearly a century. Boasting a commitment to using premier, highest-quality ingredients, some cultivated in their own gardens and others sourced from local farms, the restaurant has maintained its Michelin-star quality for almost a century, securing the #1 spot in Rome since 1928. Recently, I had the pleasure of savoring their renowned Cacio e Pepe, priced at $24.75 USD. Crafted with fresh Pecorino Romano imported from Italy, high-quality bucatini, black pepper, and butter, this dish is an exquisite blend of flavors that captures the essence of Italian nostalgia. The dedication to authenticity and the culinary expertise at Villa Borghese shines through in every bite, making it a must-visit for those seeking an unparalleled dining experience.
